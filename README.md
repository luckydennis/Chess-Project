## About
I started off thinking of creating a chess game in the console application using C#. This will allow players to play against each other or play against a computer for practice. From this Chess App game I wanted to learn more about game development and web development.


## Requirements
A PowerPoint of my requirements and flow.

## In-Process Review
I started off thinking of creating a chess game in the console application using C#. I noticed that it was taking too much time to create a chess engine so I was able to find couple C# chess libraries(ProgramFOX/Chess.Net and rudzen/ChessLib). However, I was not able to use these libraries becasue my main goal was to create a web application and I was running into problems using C# code. After doing more searching I was able to find a javascript chess library. The engine I use is [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/) and the user interface is [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/). Currently, I was able to embed the game into my website, I am thinking of adding more features.
